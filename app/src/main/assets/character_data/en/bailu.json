Some healers take the view that Vidyadhara use the rebirth cycle to repair injuries sustained during their long life-cycle, but such a notion clearly does not apply to this patient's situation.<br /><br />I have tested her blood and marrow and had her ingest translucence worms to allow a thorough examination of her brain. But I've found no diseased parts. Ah, what a marvel life is! Even long-life species exempt from aging and death are not entirely immune to the ravages of disease.<br /><br />It is the same as regards my own health. It is now six or seven years since I first sprouted horns, but I have not grown taller in that time. I am sure it is because I have those horrid Preceptors watching over me all the day long.

(Although such things are the province of the Ten-Lords Commission, I always exercise special caution in this regard.)<br /><br />It is my view that he is simply bored senseless and has slipped out to rove about when he found some free time.

Have I had any dreams lately? How have I been eating? He's more like the doctor than I am.<br /><br />I do very much enjoy chatting with the general. He's not like those old so-and-sos, no grand airs, likes to joke and tease, and he often tells me about the parts of the world he's been on expeditions to. All sorts of marvelous stuff.

   "text": "Greetings, Esteemed Preceptors:<br /><br />Star Calendar █ day of █ month, ████, routine examination of Lady Bailu, concise notes as follows:<br /><br />Still no physical change in the high elder. She has not grown. This is not unusual as slow development is common among Vidyadharas. I am more concerned about her having no dreams than the slow growth of her body.<br /><br />All past high elders, after receiving the \"Orb of Abysm\" and the \"Transmutation Arcanum,\" will re-experience the events of their dragon ancestors' lives in dreams. The Office of Deep Sources is charged with transcribing, retelling, and annotating these dreams, and their files run to an enormous number of volumes. Although such dreams tend to be fragmentary and difficult to understand or interpret, it is after all the only way our kind have of coming close to the Permanence. Yet Lady Bailu has experienced nothing of this sort. It is apparent that either her dragon heart is in some way damaged, or the \"Transmutation Arcanum\" has not been carried through in full.<br /><br />Furthermore, since the high elder has already demonstrated her powers of calling lightning and commanding the waters, I have instructed one of our finest crafters to make the Dragonhorn Pilory to shackle her tail, to prevent a loss of control over her powers and a repeat of the disaster of the Sedition of Imbibitor Lunae.<br /><br />Also, we received a missive from Caelorum Venti of the Yaoqing some months ago, inquiring into the present condition of Lady Bailu. I have replied as you instructed, esteemed elders. The gist of my reply was that Lady Bailu is still young and in need of the assistance of the Preceptors. Only after her coming-of-age ceremony will the Preceptors confer the title of Imbibitor Lunae on her.<br /><br /><align=\"right\">Respectfully yours, Yunyou, attendant to the High Elder.</align>",
