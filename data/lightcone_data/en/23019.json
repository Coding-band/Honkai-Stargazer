Her visage in the mirror seems untouched by time. But, in the grand scheme of the cosmos, is she too destined to last for but a fleeting moment?<br /><br />\"If all is set for eventual demise, what purpose, then, does creation serve?\"<br />After a silence that seems to stretch to eternity, the winds blow, the petals fall, and the reflection in the mirror tenders the same answer as always.<br />\"For the day when plum blossoms are no longer kept.\"<br />She deftly caresses the icy surface of the mirror. Such soliloquies have happened too many times for her to count.",
