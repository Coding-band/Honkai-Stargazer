At the moment, Hanya couldn't repel the heliobus by force without causing harm to Huohuo, who was still a little girl. As a result, she had to seal the heliobus onto the girl's tail.

Eons ago, a heliobus named Ignamar was defeated by a Luofu general and fragmented into numerous shards, then sealed in the Creation Furnace. This particular shard escaped, and he represents the arrogant side of Ignamar and wouldn't condescend to possessing anything, living as a vagabond for centuries... until Huohuo chanced upon him in his utter exhaustion.<br /><br />\"Then I'll call you 'Tail' to avoid unwanted attention...\"<br />The heliobus said nothing, his silence being a sign of acquiescence.",

Maybe I'm not really cut out for this job...\"<br />\"...Well, only you know the answer to that.\"<br /><br />Huohuo is not okay with her timidity. She struggled to muster the courage needed to confront the evil spirits.<br /><br />She stayed up late watching horror-comedy films in an attempt to strengthen her nerves, but all she got were dark circles. She invested in the latest scientific exorcism tools to enhance her abilities, but it only left her with empty pockets. Tail sneered at the futility of her efforts, finding ways to make sarcastic remarks and mock her.<br /><br />\"To be honest, Tail is the scariest of all...\"<br />However, in Xueyi's eyes, Huohuo has long ceased to fear Tail.",
