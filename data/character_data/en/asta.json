All they chose to see is a pampered little princess.<br /><br />\"You like stars? Oh, I get it. You're a little girl. You all like sparkly things.\"<br />\"Yes... I'm researching protostars at the moment. I hope to name the stars I discover after myself... Just like those famous astronomers of old.\"<br />\"Is that all?
