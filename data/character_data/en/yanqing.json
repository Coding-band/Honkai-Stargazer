After years of training, Yanqing's mind is as quick and sharp as the spotless sword he keeps.<br /><br />Cloud Knight combat drills attest that controlling six simultaneous flying daggers is something even Cloud Knight chief drillmasters can't master in a century.

For millennia, several talented unicorns have emerged ahead of the pack during the hunt. However, Yanqing earned a military commission before he even reached the age of majority. Some would criticize that \"the general is absurd\" on this matter.<br /><br />However, this genius' debut on the battlefield was even more explosive, and any critical voices soon fell silent.<br /><br />When hunting near a distant star, the monstrously huge mechabeast Windguard created by the Denizens of Abundance was pulverizing defense forces as though they were ants. But this young boy met against it face-to-face, claiming its head and routing the enemy to the point of collapse.<br /><br />As for subsequent victories: He broke the borisin's Devouring Wolf formation with Jing Yuan, beheading three Brood Lords. He also fought viciously against the wingweavers, ultimately sinking their almighty Cloudseizer Fleet... These are just a small footnote in the annals of his courageous swordplay.",

   "text": "If you ask Yanqing what other interests he has besides sword fighting, you'll be met with a simple answer —<br /><br />\"Interests would only affect the speed of my sword!\"<br /><br />Like a child infatuated with toys, he spares no expense in buying most of the blades manufactured by the Artisanship Commission — flying swords controlled by qi, daggers for close combat, flexible swords that can bend and adjust... He knows different sword's spec and function like the back of his mind. He'll even buy an extra copy — one to use in combat, and one for his collection. This leaves his finances in a sorrowful situation at the end of each month, where he could only beg the general for food and daily necessities.<br /><br />It's completely natural for teenage boys to love swords, but a specific dream flickers and dances among the Xianzhou swords in his collection.<br /><br />To become the best on the Luofu — no, the best across all the Xianzhou ships. To take the title of Sword Champion on the Luofu, and even take the title of Sword Preeminence across the Alliance.<br /><br />Since the Sedition of Imbibitor Lunae, the title of Sword Champion among the Luofu Cloud Knights has remained vacant for centuries. Not that nobody wants to claim it, but for a rather more embarrassing reason:<br /><br />The previous Sword Champion, a legendary swordmaster with <nobr>13</nobr> outstanding accolades, violated the laws of heaven and resulting in her name being wiped from the face of the cosmos. Even the prestigious title that she bore became a sore spot for others.<br /><br />But for this vastly impressive teen, it's now time to turn over a new page in the annals of history and write another chapter.",

   "text": "\"Bout #123: Yanqing, Jing Yuan.\"<br />\"General, let's call it a day! I'm exhausted...\"<br />\"Didn't you say you have the confidence to remain undefeated as long as you hold a sword? Why are you acting so weak?\"<br />\"What kind of retainer would take up arms against the person they vowed to protect? What if I accidentally hurt...\"<br />\"If your sword is half as quick as your mouth, I'd already have lost. I'll keep one hand behind my back. Now, be quick!\"<br />\"No no, two hands please! Or maybe you can consider not using the Lightning-Lord, general?\"<br />\"You think is like the Sky-Faring Commission's business, where you can barter your way out? Hmm, let me see...\"<br />\"Aha — a weakness! Watch this!\"<br />\"I knew you'd do that. Counter!\"<br />\"Ow-ow-ow, darn it! I'd been waiting for ages for my shot.\"<br />\"All's equal in war, and sneak attacks are a good idea. It's too bad your sword is so focused on the flourish and can't conceal its form. Is this what they call youthful vigor?\"<br />\"General, let's go again! This time I'll try to be as inconspicuous as possible...\"<br /><br />Jing Yuan spent much time and energy in raising Yanqing. Some speculated that he was cultivating an heir, others claimed he only kept him around just to use this kid as a secret weapon. Jing Yuan never offered a response.<br /><br />Yanqing became an unrivaled fighter aboard the Xianzhou Luofu as his skills grew more and more advanced. Jing Yuan gradually began thinking about ways to restrain Yanqing's edge, to take him down a peg without curbing his confidence.<br /><br />Too solid and it can shatter. Too sharp and it can blunt. More than just a sharp edge — a sword also needs a scabbard that can restrain it. In Jing Yuan's view, Yanqing has grown up exceedingly fast — beyond expectations. What Yanqing needs right now is not more strength, but the ability and experience of curbing that strength — something that can only manifest by the passage of time.",
