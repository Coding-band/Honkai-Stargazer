It felt like nature itself was celebrating her arrival: The birds chirped, the moon and sun were together in the sky. The cards in my hand seemed to hint at the emergence of a soul steeped in nostalgia. Right from her early years, she had a fascination with stories from the past. She would delve deep into contemplating our origins, our creators, and even the very beginning of the world. Her questions would leave even the most erudite scholars scratching their heads. Sure, some other kids might poke fun at her for asking such deep questions, but aren't those questions important?

Her mother was physically present, but where was she in the realm of consciousness?<br /><br />She stayed by her mother's side until the end of her life, realizing that her mother had been fading away as her memories became fragmented. If her own memories of her mother were to ever become blurred as well, her mother would completely slip away from her.<br /><br />\"Life is akin to a winding labyrinth, where memories serve as our sole companions.\" For the first time, she comprehended the profound meaning behind these words.",

My usual tasks involved observing the flow of rivers, examining the materials of the city's bricks and tiles, analyzing the steepness of roads, and documenting the number and distribution of chimneys... These duties aligned with people's imagination of preserving a planet's 'memories.'\"<br /><br />— However, such efforts were far from sufficient.<br /><br />Once I started working in secrecy, I would often come across that girl. Sometimes, sunlight would dance through the leaves as she walked beneath them, disappearing around corners once the street lamps illuminated the surroundings. On other occasions, her gaze would follow a carrier pigeon, which left the High Priest's quarters every Wednesday night, only to return the following morning to the palace's chief of the guards — a known political adversary of the High Priest. Occasionally, she would quietly observe rain trickling into sewers scarred by artillery fired from the opposite shore. And sometimes, waves would dampen her skirts, while an elderly woman washing clothes by the river recounted the story of the previous sovereign and his five illegitimate children.<br /><br />— Few individuals, apart from us, understand that a planet conceals and safeguards its \"memories\" in such a manner.<br /><br />I trailed behind her until we reached a rock on the moor. I knew that it was the time to invite her.<br /><br />\"What do you see?\" I asked, in a form visible to her.<br />She pointed at a patch of weeds and the lingering traces.<br />\"I see a stone, perhaps once part of a fireplace... But it must hold more significance.\"<br />I nodded and assisted her in removing the weeds and dirt from the crevices of the stone.<br />\"It was once a monument,\" she murmured, gently caressing the engravings adorning its surface.<br />\"Indeed, but the 'memory' holds more significance.\"<br /><br />Thus, I revealed to her that the stone on the moor had once served as a fireplace, a monument before that, a flowerbed, and even an altar... And before all that, it had simply been a stone on the moor.<br /><br />\"What price would I pay if I want to witness those 'memories'?\"<br />\"People will remain oblivious to your presence unless you are willing to reveal yourself.\"<br />\"Just as people fail to acknowledge the existence of black swans until they encounter one?\"<br />\"Yes, just like that.\"<br /><br /><align=\"right\">— An <ruby>Explorer's<rt>Memokeeper</rt></ruby> memories</align><br /><br />Memokeepers travel to numerous planets, collecting the memories of each city they encounter.

Such individuals often degenerate into unbridled Cremators, distorting memories to suit their preferences. However, she is different... I've sensed her unwavering determination and profound respect for memories themselves. Following tradition, I asked her three questions before making her a Memokeeper.<br /><br />\"Will you dedicate your whole life to the collection of memories?\"<br />\"I will.\"<br />\"Will you relinquish your physical form and embrace the transformation of self?\"<br />\"I will.\"<br />\"If one day you cease to exist, what legacy will you leave behind for the world?\"<br />\"My memories.

All I need is an honest story, for the past and the future are overlapped on the same point of a single circle.' My head spun, and she exuded such gentleness.
