Experienced extreme thirst leading to excess drinking, aching all over, particularly in the stomach, shortness of breath, and loss of big clumps of tail hair.<br /><br />Diagnosis: Food poisoning.<br /><br />Prescription: Bitter ginseng, 1 mace. Raw licorice, 1 mace and 1 candareen. Five-grain jade elixir, 1 bottle. Things You Should Know About Forbidden Foods, 1 copy.<br /><br />Usage: Boil bitter ginseng and licorice in the five-grain jade elixir until reduced to half volume, strain to remove dregs, drink as much as you like until you vomit. Copy out the pamphlet Things You Should Know About Forbidden Foods five hundred times until it's stuck in your head.<br /><br />Remarks: Classic case of food poisoning. Visceral lesions already healed with Draconic Ichor. It should suffice to take emetics as prescribed, which will effectively remove any residual poison through vomiting. I should further note that everyone knows that even the strongest, hardiest, long-life Foxians cannot eat chocolate!<br /><br />Also, for minor ailments such as this, do not make the patient wait too long.

Her growth is a hundred times faster than a normal Vidyadhara.<br /><br />Diagnosis: Rebirth abnormality, extremely rare, a one-in-a-million condition.<br /><br />Prescription: No available medicine. Drink plenty of hot water.<br /><br />Usage: Not applicable.<br /><br />Remarks: Well, this is one of those difficult cases! The sort I unfortunately am unable to treat.<br /><br />The mechanism underlying the hatching rebirth of Vidyadhara remains a mystery. Some healers take the view that Vidyadhara use the rebirth cycle to repair injuries sustained during their long life-cycle, but such a notion clearly does not apply to this patient's situation.<br /><br />I have tested her blood and marrow and had her ingest translucence worms to allow a thorough examination of her brain. But I've found no diseased parts. Ah, what a marvel life is! Even long-life species exempt from aging and death are not entirely immune to the ravages of disease.<br /><br />It is the same as regards my own health. It is now six or seven years since I first sprouted horns, but I have not grown taller in that time. I am sure it is because I have those horrid Preceptors watching over me all the day long. If a child does not get out to run about, how will it grow tall?<br /><br />Healers who read this case study, when will you release me? I am not some truly wicked ne'er-do-well.

   "text": "\"Alchemy Commission Collected Treatment Histories: Volume One Hundred and Twenty-Eight, Case Study <nobr>39</nobr><br /><br />Presiding Physician: Bailu.<br /><br />Patient: Jing Yuan, male Xianzhou native of indeterminate age (though the Ten-Lords Commission surely knows).<br /><br />Complaint: Tightness of chest and shortness of breath, drowsiness, eyes too tired to keep open. This consultation is a routine repeat check-up.<br /><br />Diagnosis: Cooped inside the Seat of Divine Foresight for far too long.<br /><br />Prescription: One serving of Garlic-infused Pork, one serving of Crisped Melon and Diced Chicken, one serving of pork slices in fish sauce, one serving of Granny Chen's Tofu, one crispy suckling pig, and one cup of Hunter Maofeng tea.<br /><br />Usage: Just eat. It will make him feel full, then naturally he'll want to get out and about to work it off, which will also improve his mood.<br /><br />Remarks: The general comes to see me about his health every year, complaining of symptoms such as \"tight chest and shortness of breath\" or \"struggling to keep eyes open\" and wanting me to give him a check-up.<br /><br />The movement of the general's qi is extremely vigorous and there are no signs of affliction by strange diseases or being stricken with mara. (Although such things are the province of the Ten-Lords Commission, I always exercise special caution in this regard.)<br /><br />It is my view that he is simply bored senseless and has slipped out to rove about when he found some free time. If that were not the case, why show up every time with a box of sweetmeats, nuts and candies and whatnot, to plonk himself down and start shooting the breeze with me? How is my health? Have I had any dreams lately? How have I been eating? He's more like the doctor than I am.<br /><br />I do very much enjoy chatting with the general. He's not like those old so-and-sos, no grand airs, likes to joke and tease, and he often tells me about the parts of the world he's been on expeditions to. All sorts of marvelous stuff. Ah, how I would love to leave doctoring behind and head off to the ends of the earth with sword in hand...!\"",

   "text": "Greetings, Esteemed Preceptors:<br /><br />Star Calendar █ day of █ month, ████, routine examination of Lady Bailu, concise notes as follows:<br /><br />Still no physical change in the high elder. She has not grown. This is not unusual as slow development is common among Vidyadhara. I am more concerned about her having no dreams than the slow growth of her body.<br /><br />All past high elders, after receiving the \"Orb of Abysm\" and the \"Transmutation Arcanum,\" will re-experience the events of their dragon ancestors' lives in dreams. The Office of Deep Sources is charged with transcribing, retelling, and annotating these dreams, and their files run to an enormous number of volumes. Although such dreams tend to be fragmentary and difficult to understand or interpret, it is after all the only way our kind have of coming close to Permanence. Yet Lady Bailu has experienced nothing of this sort. It is apparent that either her dragon heart is in some way damaged, or the \"Transmutation Arcanum\" has not been carried through in full.<br /><br />Furthermore, since the high elder has already demonstrated her powers of calling lightning and commanding the waters, I have instructed one of our finest crafters to make the Dragonhorn Pilory to shackle her tail, to prevent a loss of control over her powers and a repeat of the disaster of the Sedition of Imbibitor Lunae.<br /><br />Also, we received a missive from Caelorum Venti of the Yaoqing some months ago, inquiring into the present condition of Lady Bailu. I have replied as you instructed, esteemed elders. The gist of my reply was that Lady Bailu is still young and in need of the assistance of the Preceptors. Only after her coming-of-age ceremony will the Preceptors confer the title of Imbibitor Lunae on her.<br /><br /><align=\"right\">Respectfully yours, Yunyou, attendant to the High Elder.</align>",
