Still, Crit Rate and CRIT DMG stats are what you want to focus on, but try to keep the 1:2 ratio. Also, 121\/123 Speed for MoC is the goal for your Blade's Speed at an entry-level. 134\/136 Speed is best if you have access to exceptional gear and want a massive clear speed boost. The 2 points difference is caused by Bronya as you need to make Blade at least 2 points faster than her (and you still want to reach the 121\/134 breakpoint for her).","substats":"CRIT Rate = CRIT DMG > Speed > HP%","skill_priority":"Basic > Talent = Ultimate > Skill","traces_priority":"Cyclone of Destruction > Neverending Deaths > Vita Infinita","name":"Main DPS"}
