Next, try to hit key Speed breakpoints (121 and 134) through the combination of Speed boots, SPD 2-piece set, and sub-stats. Also, it is not recommended to use more than 1 DEF% main stat Relic - ideally, you want to use HP% as the main stats and hunt for DEF% on your subs. If you want numbers, aim for 6500-8000 HP (with Matrix Active) and 1400-1600 DEF and then focus on Speed.","substats":"HP% > DEF% >= Speed","skill_priority":"Talent > Skill > Ultimate = Basic","traces_priority":"Taiyi, the Macrocosmic (A2) > Dunjia, the Metamystic (A4) > Liuren, the Sexagenary (A6)","name":"Pure Tank"}
